The objective of this repository is to produce a tool that will query the ‘status’ page on 1000 servers and produce a report based on data within the status page.  
Each server has a ‘status’ endpoint that returns json data.  

The "solution.py" contains the code that produces report on standard output and a file.
The "responses.txt" contains standard json response after parsing server file.

Input files necessary for code to run: "servers.txt"
Output files generated: "file.txt"

The code uses Python version 2.7 and can be run using the command:
python solution.py
